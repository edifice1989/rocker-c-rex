abstract = {Genome-wide molecular gene expression studies generally compare expression values for each gene across multiple conditions followed by cluster and gene set enrichment analysis to determine whether differentially expressed genes are enriched in specific biochemical pathways, cellular components, biological processes, and/or molecular functions, etc. This approach to analyzing differences in gene expression enables discovery of gene function, but is not useful to determine whether pre-defined groups of genes share or diverge in their expression patterns in response to treatments nor to assess the correctness of pre-defined gene set groupings. Here we present a simple method that changes the dimension of comparison by treating genes as variable traits to directly assess significance of differences in expression levels among pre-defined gene groups. Because expression distributions are typically skewed (thus unfit for direct assessment using Gaussian statistical methods) our method involves transforming expression data to approximate a normal distribution followed by dividing the genes into groups, then applying Gaussian parametric methods to assess significance of observed differences. This method enables the assessment of differences in gene expression distributions within and across samples, enabling hypothesis-based comparison among groups of genes. We demonstrate this method by assessing the significance of specific gene groups' differential response to heat stress conditions in maize.},

abstract = {Author Summary Transposable elements are mobile DNA elements that are a prevalent component of many eukaryotic genomes. While transposable elements can often have deleterious effects through insertions into protein-coding genes they may also contribute to regulatory variation of gene expression. There are a handful of examples in which specific transposon insertions contribute to regulatory variation of nearby genes, particularly in response to environmental stress. We sought to understand the genome-wide influence of transposable elements on gene expression responses to abiotic stress in maize, a plant with many families of transposable elements located in between genes. Our analysis suggests that a small number of maize transposable element families may contribute to the response of nearby genes to abiotic stress by providing stress-responsive enhancer-like functions. The specific insertions of transposable elements are often polymorphic within a species. Our data demonstrate that allelic variation for insertions of the transposable elements associated with stress-responsive expression can contribute to variation in the regulation of nearby genes. Thus novel insertions of transposable elements provide a potential mechanism for genes to acquire cis-regulatory influences that could contribute to heritable variation for stress response.},
